## PDDL

## LLM
- GPT 3.5 turbo
- Used to convert the question into a structured data format(JSON)
   
## Approach
- Used PDDL, a concept of AI planning strategy, to construct a triangle
- A specific case of constructing triangles(say of 9th or 10th grade maths question from NCERT) which include steps like:
  - "Draw a base BC of 4cm"
  - "Take a compass and draw an arc with radius set to 5 cm"
  - and so on...
- The construction of triangles can be defined as a set of rules(although not all the rules are covered in my implementation) but an interesting approach in getting the steps to construct a triangle
